# fable README
This is the README for your extension "fable". After writing up a brief description, we recommend including the following sections.

## Features
Describe specific features of your extension including screenshots of your extension in action. Image paths are relative to this README file.

For example if there is an image subfolder under your extension project workspace:

\!\[feature X\]\(images/feature-x.png\)

> Tip: Many popular extensions utilize animations. This is an excellent way to show off your extension! We recommend short, focused animations that are easy to follow.

## Requirements

If you have any requirements or dependencies, add a section describing those and how to install and configure them.

## Extension Settings
Include if your extension adds any VS Code settings through the `contributes.configuration` extension point.

This extension contributes the following settings:
* `myExtension.enable`: enable/disable this extension
* `myExtension.thing`: set to `blah` to do something

## Release Notes
